# Pointless Surgeries

A set of pointless surgeries and things. For the memes.

- Bloodletting - gives bloodloss
- Essential Oils - Made from chemfuel, it gives you food poisoning. It might work, who knows?
- Healing Crystals - It's just some rocks. It might work, who knows?
- Thoughts and Prayers - Lets pray for this patient. That'll work right?
- A Tablet - Who doesn't want to endlessly doomscroll and end up with acute smooth-brain?
- Polyfillet - An amazing compound capable of smoothing out the wrinkliest of brains. Applied via surgery.
- Super Cucumber - What more is there to say.
- Trepanning - high chance to kill the pawn. Low chance to heal a permanent injury
- Administer Onion - why do I smell like onions now?
- Balance the humours - eww, leeches.
- "Vaccine" - it's got microchips in it
- Home Remedy - Yayo, Beer, and Herbal Medicine, all in one
- And more...

## ToDo
- Scope Creep - a "manager" creepjoiner that has steadily increasing expectations and demands
- Vanilla Plants Expanded compat for ðŸ¥’
  - pickles
- Fing-Longer
- birds are drones
- Stem cell surgery, chance for complete heal of any condition, but also a chance for a random body part to get cancer/get tentacled (if anomaly)
- Bracelets
  - Magnetic
  - Copper
  - etc
- Manifest Destiny ability
  - Sets all skills to 20 
  - Huge, mapwide antigrain explosion, destroy most of the map
  - Gives them Luci addiction
