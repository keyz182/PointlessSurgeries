# Pointless Surgeries

A set of pointless surgeries and things. For the memes.

- Bloodletting - gives bloodloss
- Essential Oils - Made from chemfuel, it gives you food poisoning. It might work, who knows?
- Healing Crystals - It's just some rocks. It might work, who knows?
- Thoughts and Prayers - Lets pray for this patient. That'll work right?
- A Tablet - Who doesn't want to endlessly doomscroll and end up with acute smooth-brain?
- Polyfillet - An amazing compound capable of smoothing out the wrinkliest of brains. Applied via surgery.
- Super Cucumber - What more is there to say.

## ToDo
- Scope Creep - a "manager" creep that has steadily increasing expectations and demands
- Vanilla Plants Expanded compat for ðŸ¥’
  - pickles
